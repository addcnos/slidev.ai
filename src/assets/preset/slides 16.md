<!--
We introduced many conventions to reduce the need of having boilerplates, or code duplications.

We also make quite some abstractions in order to shift the complexities from user app to the framework. So that's when you building an app with Nuxt, you can focusing more on the your own logic instead of worrying about the technical details of how bundler works, etc.

We are trying our best to provide the sensible default that makes Nuxt works out of box with zero configration, while keeping the best practice for you to deliver your app with the best performance and user experience.

We also put quite some effort in terms of normalizations of underlying tools. With unplugin, we smooth out the details between Vite and Webpack, make Nuxt support both interchangeably based on your needs. With Nitro, we make deployment easier than ever. With the same codebase, you can deploy your app to any hosting providers, like Vercel or Netlify, or hosting your own Node or Deno server, without any code changes.

===

Those features are super awesome, but we see that the trade-off we have to make is to sacrifice a bit of the transparency. By transparency, I mean, the ability to see what's going on under the hood, the cost of learning and understanding each feature Nuxt provides. This trade-off is inevitable, as for any tools, you have to learn before you can use it. But how we could make it better? That's where Nuxt DevTools comes in.

<!--
And we are honored to hear that there are a few projects are inspired by Nuxt DevTools

We have vite-plugin-vue-devtools, a Vite plugin that ported some features from Nuxt DevTools, covering the Vue users that are not on Nuxt yet. We are working closely together to explore the possibilities of better experience for Vue and share the common parts.

We also have vite-plugin-devtools, an experiment to have a universal Vite DevTools that works for different frameworks.

Then we have heard that Modern.js and Qwik is building their own DevTools, with the similiar approach of Nuxt DevTools to provide in-app DevTools for their users.

We are super excited to see more and more projects are exploring the possibilities of DevTools and Developer Experience. That we could learn from each other and explore together to make it even better.

<!--
Nuxt DevTools 1.0 serves as a milestone. There are no many new features in 1.0, but it's more like a statement indicates that Nuxt DevTools' approach is mature enough. We are marking the Modules API as stable, so that module authors could provide the integrations more confidently. We also did some UI improvements since the previous versions. And most importantly, Nuxt DevTools will be ship with Nuxt 3.8 and general available to all Nuxt users. By doing that, we want to make sure the onboarding experience as seamless as possible. Meaning that by default, you won't see any visual different in you app. The DevTools will be hidden to minimize the distraction. Instead, we will print an instrution in your terminal telling you that you can press a shortcut to enable it as you want. Making the opt-in as easy as possible.

# Upcoming

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Nuxt Accessibility Integration

- Pinia Playground
- Vue DevTools Integration
  - Reactivity Inspector

  - Render Tree
  - Props Editor
- "DevTools Kit"

  - A shared infra and conventions for building devtools

</v-clicks>

<!--
And after Nuxt DevTools 1.0, there are a few upcoming things I'd like to share with you:

The first is that we are working on a Nuxt Accessibility module, provide accessibility hints and suggestion for you Nuxt app. And we will build an UI for it in Nuxt DevTools.

And the next is the Pinia playground, something that has been requested for a long time. We will provide a playground for you to inspect and play with the states in your Pinia store.

We are also working with Vue team to experiment the reactivity tracking in Vue. Including features like Render Tree and Props Editor. Our plan is to unify Nuxt DevTools and Vue DevTools to have all the things in one place.

And lastly, we came up an idea called DevTools Kit, a shared infrastructures and conventions for building devtools. Let me explain a bit more about it.
-->

<DevToolsKit />

<!--
DevTools Kit is currently just an idea and we are still brainstroming. But here that me share what we imagine it could be.

We see that each feature provided by Nuxt DevTools have each own scope, some are Nuxt specific, some are Vue specific, some are more about general Web Developement. We think in the best world, each feature could be modular, composable and collabrative.

For example, we could have general features for Web, such as SEO tools, editor integrations, accessibility, etc.
And then, we could have Vite specific features, such as Bundle Analyzer, Transform Inspector, etc.
About Vue, we could have tabs like components, reactivity inspector and so on.
On top of that, we then could have some Nuxt specific features like Nuxt modules, Server API and so on.

Imagine we might able to integrate React's DevTools, state management. Or routes and components view for Svelte, reactivity tracking for Solid, chunking view for Qwik, or even webpack and rspack integrations.

Other than frameworks and bundlers, we could have other integrations like Vitest, UnoCSS, Storybook, Histories and many many more.

With the whole picture, we could found the Nuxt DevTools, is actually the composition of different features here. Nuxt is a Vue meta framework, so we could have all Vue features adding Nuxt specific features.

With a bit limited scope, excluding Nuxt features, we will have Vue DevTools. Similarly, one day we might see a React DevTools coming, sharing the majority of the common features here, and maybe a Svelte DevTools, a Solid DevTools, a Qwik DevTools, or even Morden.js DevTools that aren't built on top of Vite.

In that regards, maybe you can pick what you need a compose your own DevTools?

So, that's our vision, each feature could share and collabrate across different frameworks and benefit to all frameworks. Indeed there are quite some challenges to make it happen, we will see how far we could go. Stay tuned!
