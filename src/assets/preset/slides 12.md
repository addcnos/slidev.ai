I am really appericated the chance I got that allows me to work on Open Source full-time. I'd like to say thank you for everyone that giving the support and opportunities and made this possible to me.

It was always my dream to work in Open Source and build things that can help people around the world, attending awesome events like this, and meeting so many great people in the community.

I believe many of you are like me, are interested in doing open source. So today here, [click] I'd like to share some of my thoughts and experiences I got. Hopefully it can provide some inspirations for your own open source journey.

Open source is quite a big topic that I can't really cover everything in one talk. [click] So I am trying to break it down and talk about different aspects of open source in each talk and make them a series.
Today, it's going to be the Part 2 - [click] "The Progressive Path".

</div>

<!--
So first, before we diving into today's topic, let's discuss a bit what we are expecting when working in open source.

We know that most of the open source projects we use daily are tools, but have you ever think about the question that, what defines a tool?

[click] The definition should be pretty straightforward and maybe you already have the answer in your mind.

[click] In my interpretation, a tool should help you get things done faster and/or easier, at least one of them.

I guess no one wants to use a tool that makes things slower and more complicated, right?

<!--
So assume we want to build a new open source project, a tool for people to use. What would you consider to justify if the tool you going to build is a good one or not?

Well, my answer is no, you can't not really tell that without being verified by the community - because there are so many factors that can affect if an open source project would work out or not.

But also, I want to emphasize that in this context, "Good" is a relative term that deps on your expectation.
It's totally ok to build a tool that solves your own problem and call it a day - it's a great tool that works for you anyway.
Actually I have a plenty of such tools and I am happy about that even no one else is using them, but they get my job done at the end of the day, right?

So let's revise our goal. Let's say we want to build a tool that can be beneficial to not only ourselves but also to more people, and probably the community could also help us to make the tool better for everyone.

[click] So the question becomes how could we make a general and useful tool for ppl to use?.

[click] I'd say every decision comes with a trade-off. When users consider if they want to use a tool, they would justify and cost and the benefits they can get from it.

[click] So here we have a balance. If I gonna to put two most important factors on the balance, I'd pick "Cost of learning and using the tools" verse the "Cost of doing something oneself".

[click] In order to make users willing to use our tool, I'd say that the "Cost of learning" should be much less than the "Cost of doing"
[click] This has been my little go-to formula to pre-evaluate if idea I have is worthwhile.

For example, let's say if we want to get a summary of 10 numbers. Would you look for a library to do that? Probably no, because we could do it with a single loop in 2 line of code - the cost of doing ourself is too low that we don't even consider getting a tool.

But if we are going to do some calculus, I am certainly going to find a library to do it for me, because I basically forget everything I learned in my college XD.

However, on the other hand, if the library we picked requires us to understand like 100 different configurations before being able to use it, uhumm, we probably going to find another library that might be easier.

Thus we know that, when we are making tools, we have to think about those cases and find a good balance to make the tool worthwhile.

</div>

<!--
So, here we know that we should probably reduce the "Cost of using a tool" to make it easier for ppl to pick up.

[click] From my point of view, the cost of a tool is composed by the following factors.

[click] The first one is the "Cost of Discovering". [click] It's about how commonly for people to realize they need to find a tool for a certain task. It also means the tool should be well-described so that people can easily get what the tool is for with one or two sentences.

[click] Then we have the "Cost of Learning". [click] This is a particularly important one in my opinion. It's about how easy for people to understand and get started with the tool. As the tool is supposed to be used and to make the actual work easier, we certainly don't want users to struggle on learning it for too long before they can be benefited from it.

[click] And then we have the "Price". The cost of the tools itself. [click] We are lucky that in Open Source, the majority of the tools are free to use. Thanks to every maintainer and contributor behind the scenes and making so much awesome tools for everyone to use. And of course, on the other hand, if the tool is not free, this is definitely one of the factors that users would consider on choosing.

[click] And the last one is the "Cost of Adoption". [click] Like how to install and integrate into ones project, how extensible the tool is for potential future needs, how migration would cost, etc.

All those factors are introduced because of the use af an external tool. In the end, we want to see the cost of the tool to be paid off by the benefits it provides.

We know that the complexity of things might transfer from one place to another, but not going to magically disappear. If we are solving a complex problem, it would be honestly hard to prevent the tool from getting complex too. For that, what I learned from the popular open source tools out there is something called "Progressive".

</div>

<!--
So, after this long intro, finally we are back to our topic today - what's is Progressive?

I think progressive a self is pretty self explaining. But here let's take a quick example with illustrations:

[click] So this is me, [click] and I am trying to get from the first floor to the second. But unfortunately, I hit a wall. The only way to get to there is to jump through the wall. But I'm not a very sports person, so I'm not able to jump that high. In case I might end giving up and turn back around. [click] That's a shame because I failed to accomplish what I aiming for because it's too hard.

So from a progressive perspective, I think that's why stairs has been invented.

[click] It allows me to take multiple smaller steps to going upward, and eventually achieve a certain goal that will be very hard to reach without it.

[click] So here, my interpretation to progressive is that the "stairs" to make things easier to approach.

Let's take some real world examples of how progressive works in our daily tools.

If you go to the official Vue documentation, vuejs.org. [click] You see the headline describe itself as the progressive JavaScript framework. And inside the docs, [click] there's a statements mention that Vue is a framework that can grow with you and adopt with your needs.

I have heard people saying that one of the main selling points of Vue is that Vue is very easy to learn and get started. And more than that, I also see Vue is awesome because it can be used in basically everywhere thanks to the progressive approach it takes.

# Progressive on Integrations

Vue offers multiple ways to use, for different level of integrations:

<div pt3 />

<v-clicks>

- CDN without build tools

- As Web Components
- Single-page application (SPA)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Native targeting
- Vue Vapor Mode <sup op50 italic font-serif>Coming soon</sup>

</v-clicks>

<!--
Vue is progressive on integrations. Vue provides multiple builds and offers many ways to use in different scenarios.

[click] Like you can use Vue with a single line of CDN import, and enhance your web apps even in a static HTML file without any build tools.

[click] You can also use Vue components as Web components so that's it can coexist with the other frameworks. Vice versa you can also import web components within Vue applications.

[click] When we have build tools set up, we can build Vue applications with Vue single file components that colocate necessary context inside a single file. To build interactive single page application with ease.

[click] With tools like VitePress, it allows you to have efficient static side generation that ships minimal JavaScript while retains a great developer experience.

[click] With tools like Nuxt, we could have server-side rendering with Vue to maximize the end-user experience as well as better SEO results.

[click] Native targeting it also possible via Ionic or NativeScripts.

[click] And then we have the upcoming Vapor mode, which allows components to opt-in a more performance VNode-less render engine to optimize even further in performance critcal scenarios.

<!--
Vue's approach provides the progressive on the levels of integrations.

Allows it to cover the needs for different scenarios, or even coexist with other technologies. [click] This means even you have a large codebase using other stacks but want to use Vue, you can still adopt some parts of you app to use Vue first, and gradually migrate each part slowly. As far as I know, for example, [Wikimedia also picked Vue](https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikitech-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/SOZREBYR36PUNFZXMIUBVAIOQI4N7PDU/) and started enhancing with Vue.

In the end, the goal is to make our tool easy to adapt for different levels of needs so we could serve a wilder range of the users.

All you need is to have `nuxt` installed as your dev dependencies [click], and create a simple Vue component file as `app.vue`. [click]

And that's it, that's all you need to get start with Nuxt. Even to someone who never tried Vue or Nuxt, it's probably not hard to tell what this will render, or how to modify it, as long as they get the basic idea of what is HTML.

[click] I think Nuxt's "Intuitive" here [click] means that you can get started with very minimal knowledge. While also, it should be fairly easy to enable more features as needed.

Then let's talk about one other aspect that Nuxt is good at - Progressive on features.

So we know that Nuxt works with a bare minimal starter, be also we know a real-world application won't be that simple. We need a lot capability to accomplish various needs, and also a way for us to organize the codebase in an managable way.

[click] Nuxt is the framework that can grows with your need!

[click] To say, if you want to some components to separate and reuse your logic, [click] in Nuxt you can just create components files under the components directory, and they will be auto-discoverabale across your project.

[click] And then if you our app needs the capability to serve multiple pages and do the navigations, [click] you can create the `pages/` directory. The components under it will be register automatically to your router based on their filename. One of the other great part is that until you do this, `vue-router` or related code were never ships to your production app before you actually using it.

[click] Say our app is now ready to go, we want to deploy the site to somewhere. There are quite many deploy platform you can choose from, and usually you will need to learn a bit how to deploy X framework on Y platform, etc. [click] But with Nuxt, they will just works on all major hosting services with zero config, thanks for the automatic deploy presets powered by Nitro.

[click] It's common for an web app to have some server logics and API end points. [click] In Nuxt you can simply create function modules under `server/api` directory, witha a very similar convention like the pages for routing. Nitro will deploy them in the serverless functions based on your hosting services and we have the end-to-end type safety on developement.

[click] Talking about type safety, if later you learned TypeScript and want to use it with in Nuxt - [click] no problem, you can directly use them as Nuxt already understand it.

[click] For more features like Progressive Web Apps, Search engine optimization, internationallizations, etc. [click] Nuxt provides a rich module ecosystem that you can integrate them within a few clicks.

[click] And finally, in case you are interested in more features Nuxt provides, [click] we also built Nuxt DevTools for you to inspect the internals or analyze your apps.

All those features are opt-in, meaning that if you don't need a certain feature, you don't even need to learn it. And once you find it useful later, you can always grab it back easily.

To help with the features discovery, we made Nuxt DevTools as we just mentioned.

For example, DevTools provides a modules tab, that you can have a quick overview of how many modules you have installed, with links to their documentations or the source code repo. It also offers you a nice UI for you to search through all the modules across the community, and you can ask DevTools to automatically download them and install for you with a single click.

[click] DevTools is built to help features discovery and understanding, to assist you crafting even more awesome applications.

On top of the documentation site Nuxt has, in the past months we started to build an interactive tutorial playground. Some of you here probably have watched my live streaming on building it, thank you for working together with me btw.

So Nuxt Tutorial allows beginners to have a more linear, step-by-step learning experience. So they can start playing with Nuxt more easier without the need to install or setup.

[click] This is another case that we are trying to get the progressive onboard experience even smoother.

[click] In the "Vite philosophy" section, the docs mentions that "Vite works closely with projects in the ecosystem to minimize regressions on each release".

Vite is on major version 5 right now. And during the past 4 years, we basically keep the pace of release 1 major version per year to keep up the JavaScript ecosystem and the evolving standards.

Some of you probably have been through that periods where we do major releases. The last one with Vite 5 and was released on November last year.

It's not a secret that Vite's major releases have very smooth migration paths. We received many comments mentions about their successful migrations cases.

## A Typical Vite Plugin

<div flex="~ gap-2 items-center">
  <div i-logos-npm-icon />
  package.json
</div>

```json
{
  // ...
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vite": "^2.9.0 || ^3.0.0 || ^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

</div>

<div mt4 relative>
<span v-click>The plugin keeps working from <span v-mark.underline.purple="3">Vite 2 to Vite 5</span></span>
<img src="/vite-3years.png" absolute left-65 top-10 rotate-10 w-33 alt="3 years in between" v-click />
</div>

<!--
If you look into the Vite plugins you are using, you will find many of their `package.json` follow a similar pattern like this:

[click] Vite appears in the `peerDependencies`  with the version range from Vite 5 all the way down to Vite 2.

[click] This means that the plugin keeps working from Vite 2 to Vite 5 perfectly without the need to even drop support of the previous Vite versions.

[click] Not to mention there is 3 years of time in between, for such an active tool like Vite.

Vite team has put a lot of care in it to make this possible. We care a lot about every changes we made, that we even work out the idea of "Ecosystem CI" that runs the test of major downstream frameworks on almost every pull requests to make sure they has the minimal impact to the ecosystem. This practice has been later adopted to Vue, Nuxt and many other frameworks.

And that brings up one other aspect of progressive.

Progressive on Breaking Changes.

I guess probably no one likes breaking changes. But somehow breaking changes are also quite important for the codebase to stay healthy and more maintainable in the long run. It help us to fix imperfectness of our previous design, with a better context we have today. While it's had to avoid introducing them, I believe maybe there would be some ways to make it the transition smoother and easier for the users to adopt.

[click] Taking the experience we had in Vue and Vite, I see there are two major ways to achieve that. Here we bring back the graph we had before, refering to the jump between major versions 1 and 2.

[click] One way of make breaking changes progressively is to do Forward Compatibility, [click] and the other is Backward Compatibility. Let me explain. [click]

[click] Forward Compatibility is about to compatible with versions in the future, like to say if you know what's the new features you going to have in the next breaking change, you bring the features back to the current version in a non-breaking way.

[click] In practice, often we will introduce flags such as `experimental` or `future` for users [click] to explicitly opt-in those changes if they want to try the new stuff, while the mainstream of the users can still be on the current version without breakages.

[click] In Vue, we have the example of `@vue/composition-api` plugin back in Vue 2, which provide the capability of using Vue 3's composition API for Vue 2 apps before they can migrate to Vue 3.

And later we have Vue v2.7, 2 years after Vue 3.0 has released, to have composition API support bake in, and align more with Vue 3's behaviour and feature sets.

For Nuxt, we introduced Nuxt Bridge, to briging the changes betwen Nuxt 2 and 3.

[click] Then it's take about Backforward compatibility, which you might heard this more often. It's about to be compactible with the previous versions.

[click] A common practice is that we will mark a certain feature as deprecated, that will print warnings upon usage. And eventually removed later in the next major version or so. This also means it's better to do smaller and a bit more frequent major releases to make the migration easier.

[click] Talking about examples, in Vue we have the compatibility build, that use Vue 3 as the fundation but with additional flags to simulate the legacy Vue 2 behaviour. That you can migrate once a feature. On Nuxt we have Nuxt Kit that allows module aurthor to build modules that would in both Nuxt 2, Bridge and Nuxt 3. etc.

<h3 v-click text-white:50>Provide <span text-orange v-mark.underline.orange.delay400.op75="1">"middle stages"</span> for migration, coexist of legacy & new</h3>

<!--
From my understand, I think the progressive of breaking changes is fundamentally allowing the co-existence.

[click] When we make changes, we should provide the "middle stages" for ppl to take a rest on migration, allowing the coexistence of both legacy and new. So the work can be done progressively, and reduce the chance of breakages.

<!--
So, to recap today's topic, we have talked the progressiveness on different aspects of building a tool.

[click] The first is about progressive on onboarding, [click] we should make the tool easy to learn and understand, for more people to start benefited from the tool we build.

[click] And then we talked about the progressive on integration [click] for our tool to cover different scenarios, and easy to adopt.

[click] Then we have the progressive on features, it's pretty common that we want to make our very powerful but that could be overhelming for the users to starts with. [click] So, taking the progressive approach would allows us to start minimal and grow with the users.

[click] And then finally, we have progressive on breaking changes, [click] to provide middle stages to make migrations step by step.

<h3 v-click text-white:50>Enables users the capability of <span text-lime font-bold v-mark.highlight.lime.op5.delay200="1" inline-block p3 mx--2>"Divide and Conquer"</span></h3>

<!--
There are much more aspects of progressiveness that we didn't have time to talk about today, but my goal today is to bring this idea of "Progressive Path" to you.

It might not seems to be a very cool or unusual stuff that people would get excited about, but I think it is playing a very important role to our daily software development. And we should think about it more often when building stuff, not only for open source projects, but also probably also for your products, or the ways of doing stuff in general.

[click] To finish my talk with one sentence, I'd say "To provide the progressive paths, is to enable users the capability of 'Divide and Conquer' towards the goals they have".

I hope you enjoy and find it useful.
